### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses and extends the SQL language. It is known for its reliability, scalability, and extensibility. PostgreSQL supports various data types, indexing, and advanced features like transactions and concurrency control. It is commonly used as a backend database for web applications.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language for managing and manipulating relational databases. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a specific relational database management system that uses SQL as its query language. In other words, SQL is a language, while PostgreSQL is a software implementation of a relational database system that uses SQL.

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?
psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -h your_host -p your_port

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?
WHERE is used to filter rows before they are grouped and aggregated.
HAVING is used to filter groups after they have been formed by a GROUP BY clause.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?
An INNER JOIN retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.
An OUTER JOIN retrieves all records from one table and the matched records from another table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
In a LEFT OUTER JOIN, all records from the left table are retrieved, and the matching records from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
In a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, all records from the right table are retrieved, and the matching records from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that allows for the conversion between data stored in relational databases and the object-oriented programming language used in applications. ORM frameworks, such as SQLAlchemy for Python or Hibernate for Java, provide a way to interact with databases using object-oriented code, making it easier for developers to work with databases by using programming language constructs rather than SQL.

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
  AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a client-side technology that enables asynchronous communication between the browser and the server, typically using JavaScript. requests is a Python library used for making HTTP requests from the server side.
AJAX requests are initiated from the client-side (browser) without reloading the entire page, while requests is used on the server side to make HTTP requests from within a server-side script.
AJAX is often used in web applications to update parts of a page dynamically, while requests is commonly used in server-side scripts to interact with external APIs or services.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser into making an unintended request to another site where the user is authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user.

The purpose of a CSRF token is to mitigate CSRF attacks. It is a unique, unpredictable value generated by the server and included in a form or request. The token is then validated by the server when the request is submitted, ensuring that the request originated from the same site and was not forged by a malicious third party.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
In the context of web development using a framework like Flask with WTForms, form.hidden_tag() is used to render a hidden input field in an HTML form. This hidden field typically contains a CSRF token. Including this token in forms helps protect against CSRF attacks by ensuring that the form submission originates from the same site that generated the form. The token is checked on the server side when the form is submitted, and the request is processed only if the token is valid.
